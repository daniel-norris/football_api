# Random Football Generator

### We're setting you a technical challenge

Deadline of Sunday 28th June at 23:59
Please upload it to the folder provided to you on Slack
Please include your CV.

Your challenge will then be sent to the hiring partners as part of the interview and selection process.

The intention is that this goes some way towards demonstrating your technical abilities in written code, something which employers don't get much insight into in a normal interview. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate your technical thinking and communication skills.

### The Brief

The core of the challenge is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names.

It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Some optional advanced features might include:
support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams
support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each players strength is used to allocate teams fairly
